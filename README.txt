ScalaImageViewer - Windows picture viewer

ScalaImageViewer allows the selection, editing and viewing of jpeg and gif image files and directories containing image files. 

You can cut and paste images to alter what's being displayed and you can save the full path names of files you want to display in a separate file. 
These full path file lists can be read into the application via their file names (unsurprisingly). 

The images can be viewed sequentially using the timed viewer and the refresh rate can be changed to anything over 20 ms allowing a 
short series of images to be viewed as a brief film.

The fastest way to navigate through visible files is using the mouse buttons or left/right keys. 
The display can be resized and the image is transformed within the code.

One feature of the application is very fast navigating and a history mechanism that allows edits and/or file/directory inserts to be undone. 

Example Code

In the code presented there are functioning examples for using menus and  catching events. 
Also there is a simple controllable task runner which has a myriad of applications.
